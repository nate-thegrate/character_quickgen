### Auto-Configure Stats

Assigning stats at random can lead to potentially undesirable outcomes: for instance, you could end up with a character with a really low Constitution score. This app gives the option to automatically allocate stats into a viable configuration.

### Random Arrays

The standard methods for determining character stats are outlined below:

| 4d6 Drop Lowest | Standard Array | Point Buy |
|---|---|---|
| For each stat, roll four 6-sided dice and add the highest 3 results together | Take the values 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8 and assign them however you'd like | Similar to Standard Array, but you can tweak the numbers if you want (e.g. change the 13 to a 12 and change the 8 to a 9) |
|   |   |   |
| Pro: randomness can be really fun & exciting | Pro: fast, easy, and fair | Pro: fair, provides some variety |
| Con: can create unfair power discrepancies | Con: boring/monotonous | Con: tedious/time consuming |

Randomized arrays are a great way to get all of the benefits with none of the drawbacks! Just take a bunch of similarly effective arrays (the above link includes a bunch and supports copy/paste) and pick one at random.

# Call of Cthulhu

Making a character in Call of Cthulhu 7th edition is a pretty lengthy process:

1. Determine your characteristics: STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, APP, INT, POW, and EDU
2. Pick an age and apply its effects
3. Use your characteristics to determine Sanity Points, Magic Points, Luck, Hit Points, and Move Rate
4. Choose an occupation based on your characteristics
5. Determine how many Skill Points you can allocate based on your occupation and Intelligence score
6. Create a backstory, either using your own ideas or by referencing the rulebook

This app does it in a couple seconds.
